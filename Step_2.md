# ![Brown Mailer Icon](xTension/icon48.png)  Brown Mailer Chrome Extension - Step 2: You Actually Made It!

## 🎉 Congratulations, You Survived Step 1!

Look at you, managing to complete the first step. I’m honestly surprised. Most people would’ve given up by now, crying about how "tech is hard" while clutching their overpriced lattes. But not you. You’ve crawled your way to **Step 2**, and for that, I offer you the smallest amount of respect possible.

Don’t get too comfortable though—this next part requires **actual effort**. Follow the steps properly, or go back to Step 1 and question all your life choices. Just kidding, it’s easy since I’m basically an egret or something.

## ⚙️ Configurations

If you need to tweak API permissions or run the backend on your **own cloud server**, update:

- **`manifest.json`** → Change `host_permissions` from `http://localhost:3000/*` to your fancy backend URL.
- **`popup.js`** → Update `fetch` requests so they don't scream **localhost** forever.

## ⚠️ A Few Friendly Warnings

- **Don’t go full spammer mode.** Recruiters have blocking powers, and you don’t want to end up in the void.
- **Yes, you still need a backend.** But let’s keep things simple—just make sure it’s running, and this extension will do the rest.
- **Emails are AI-generated**—so if they sound like Shakespeare wrote them, well… you're welcome. 😉
